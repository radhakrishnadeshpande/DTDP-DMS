The purpose of the DTDP department management system is to automate the existing manual system with the help of computerised equipment and full-fledged computer software, fulfilling their requirements so that the valuable data and information can be stored for a longer period of time with easy access. The system is a web-based application that can be accessed throughout the department. It deals with all kind of student details, academic related reports, course details, curriculum, batch details and other resource related details too. It tracks all the details of a student from the day one to the end of his course which can be used for all reporting purpose, tracking of attendance, progress in the course, completed semesters years, coming semester year curriculum details, project or any other final exam result and all these will be available for future references too.
Our program will have the databases of students details, subjects details, attendance records, marks record and its department details in all aspects. DTDP department management system, as described above, can lead to an error-free, secure, reliable, and fast management system. It can help the user concentrate on their other activities rather than on the record-keeping. This system may be used for monitoring the overall activities as well as performance of the students. This system is being developed to maintain and facilitate easy access to information. For this the users must be registered with the system after which they can access as well as modify data as per the permissions given to them. It is a web based application that aims at providing information to all the levels of department.
This system also contains all other books in the library module which are related to the DTDP department. For a given student/faculty can access the system to either upload or download some information from the database. Thus, it will help department in better utilise their resources.
